This repository is made to submit a task. The task was to train a deep learning model, basically a classification model for a given dataset.
At first the python dependencies were imported. Then the data is imported using pandas. After that the data is splitted into training and testing datasets in the ratio of 80:20.
Normalization of these splitted datasets is done for the better accuracy of the model and then the model is created.
A Multi-layer perceptron model is created using the tensorflow library. Later the training dataset is fitted in the model.
Following things can be found as output:
1) Model Accuracy curve ( of both test and train datasets)
2) Model loss curve ( again of both test and train datasets)
3) H5 model 
4) Accuracy of the model
5) Precision of the model
